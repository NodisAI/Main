          Go to [https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations) and create a new **internal** integration or select an existing one.

          While we limit the scope of Notion API's exposed (for example, you will not be able to delete databases via MCP), there is a non-zero risk to workspace data by exposing it to LLMs. Security-conscious users may want to further configure the Integration's _Capabilities_. 
          For example, you can create a read-only integration token by giving only "Read content" access from the "Configuration" tab:
          ![Notion Integration Token Capabilities showing Read content checked](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/images/integrations-capabilities.png)
          This should looks like `{"Authorization": "Bearer ntn_****", "Notion-Version": "2022-06-28" }`
